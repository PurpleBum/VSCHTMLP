        <h2>Who is <a href="www.instagram.com/marskidris" class="Name">Kolade</a>?</h2>
        <p><a href="instagram.com/marskidris">Kolade Idris</a> is a young Nigerian-American that began his coding journey in 2020. Since then he's has had his fair share of ups and downs. Including several breaks at different points from the frustration of not knowing how to truly begin.</p> <!--link instagram correctly!-->
        <p>I'm sure we've all heard how the Tech Industry is a completely lucrative job market with many open positions. With many open positions on <a href="indeed job link">Indeed</a>, which offer a variety of remote and office jobs. Such a Front or Back end Dev. Web Devs, Senior and Junior Engineers and so much more.</p>
        <p>I know I've seen my fair share and have watch plenty of Youtube videos of self taught people younger and older than me showing off how they've landed lucrative jobs in the Tech market. It is my hope with the beginning of this website to showcase my journey from start to finish of the process I've gone through in order to prep myself for those type of jobs.</p>
        <p>Using this site, I will record my journey from end to end. Showing the classes I've taken at my local community college to the websites I've used to learn everything I'm doing now. I hope to bring those who are interested in my progress or those who want to pursue a similar field along for the journey. Thank you for taking the time to check out <a href="index.html" class="Code">Code with Kolade</a></p>
