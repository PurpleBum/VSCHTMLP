# VSCHTMLPractice
 Learning HTML and CSS. These are my practice websites excluding the ones from school.
The first file, Practice Odin, is everything I learned and practiced from www.theodinproject.com 
I have started by building a hierarchical website with index.html as the home page and starting page to find all other sources. Although I didn't program a Nav as i didn't want to detour from the lesson the odin project was teaching me. 
I've created three different sites and recipes as suggested using three different online sources mentioned in each source code. These recipes are ones that I've cooked myself and is a taste of Nigerian cuisine. Try them out if you have the chance!
